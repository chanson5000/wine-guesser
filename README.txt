Project Title: WINE GUESSER

Author: Cory Hanson

Description: I wanted to create a tool to help aspiring sommeliers in their blind tasting efforts. While employing the deductive tasting method and going through wine tasting grid, input your observations into the wine guesser input forms. Wine Guesser will do its best to guess the wine varietal based on your observations.

Motivation: The application is a great tool to merge my desire to improve my coding and my love for the study wine.

Build Status: The Wine Guesser application is currently in a beta state. I have not decided to do any version-ing, possibly until I get it out of what I consider the beta state.

Features: Along with the front end of the web site, there is a back end administration area where you can view all of the wine varietals in the database and make additions, modifications, and deletions.

Installation: I am not providing installation instructions or the SQL database I propagated with the wine characteristics just yet.

Contributions: I would welcome suggestions or contributions to this project.
